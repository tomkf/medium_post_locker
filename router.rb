#this file will run the actuall app
# router.run


# This time we didn't give you the app.rb.
#  Don't be afraid, just take the problem from the end.
#  We know that the purpose of the app.rb file is to call router.run.
#   This means you need to instantiate a router which is an instance of our Router class.
#   OK so that's a Router.new(controller). That means we need a controller...
#    Following this train of thoughts will lead you to the whole code.


class Router

    initialize(controller)
    @controller = controller
    end
    
    end
